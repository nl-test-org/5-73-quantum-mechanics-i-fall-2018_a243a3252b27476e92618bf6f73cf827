This course presents the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics: wave properties, uncertainty principles, the Schrödinger equation, and operator and matrix methods. Key topics include commutation rule definitions of scalar, vector, and spherical tensor operators; the Wigner-Eckart theorem; and 3_j_ (Clebsch-Gordan) coefficients. In addition, we deal with many-body systems, exemplified by many-electron atoms (“electronic structure”), anharmonically coupled harmonic oscillators (“intramolecular vibrational redistribution: IVR”), and periodic solids.
